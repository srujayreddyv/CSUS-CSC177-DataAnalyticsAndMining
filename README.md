# CSC 177: Data Analytics and Mining

As a student in CSC 177 at Sacramento State University, I've compiled this repository as a personal collection of lab tutorials and resources for the course. It's designed to complement our hands-on learning experience with a range of data analytics and machine learning techniques.

## About This Course

In CSC 177, we're diving into the core principles and practices of data analytics and mining. The tutorials included here have been instrumental in teaching me how to preprocess data, conduct various forms of analyses, and interpret results to inform data-driven decision-making.

## Lab Notebooks

I maintain a `labs` directory here which houses Jupyter notebooks corresponding to each lab session we've completed:

- **Tutorial 1: Python Basics** - This was our starting point, getting familiar with the basics of Python.
- **Tutorial 2: Numpy** - Here, I learned how to perform numerical operations using the Numpy library.
- **Tutorial 3: Pandas** - This tutorial taught me data manipulation and analysis with Pandas.
- **Tutorial 4: Data Preprocessing** - I explored various techniques to clean and prepare data for analysis.
- **Tutorial 5: Regression** - I practiced building regression models to forecast numerical values.
- **Tutorial 6: Classification** - This covered methods for classifying data into predefined groups.
- **Tutorial 7: Text Processing** - I developed skills for processing and analyzing textual data.
- **Tutorial 8: Clustering** - I experimented with unsupervised learning to cluster similar data points.
- **Tutorial 9: Association Analysis** - Lastly, I discovered how to uncover interesting patterns in large data sets.

Each notebook includes my code, notes, and observations from the exercises and assignments.
