# CSC177- Project 1: Data Preprocessing Project (Fall 2023)
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "Data Preprocessing Project" conducted by Team Challengers as part of CSC 177- Data Analytics and Mining course during the Fall 2023 semester. In this project, we've tackled the critical domain of data preprocessing, a fundamental step in the world of data science and data engineering. Data preprocessing comprises approximately 80% of the efforts involved in real-world data projects, making it a cornerstone of data analysis.

# Overview
In this project, we have covered a wide range of data preprocessing tasks using Python, leveraging popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. Our project is structured to guide you through various steps, from loading and cleaning data to exploring, visualizing, and transforming it for downstream analysis.

# Key Highlights
1. Data Loading: We have used the Acoustic Extinguisher Fire Dataset, loaded from Google Drive, as the foundation for our project.
2. Handling Missing Data: Missing values are a common challenge in real-world datasets. We demonstrate techniques to handle missing data effectively, from dropping rows with missing values to filling them with appropriate statistics.
3. Outlier Detection: Detecting and handling outliers is crucial in data preprocessing. We employ box plots and visualization techniques to identify and manage outliers in the dataset.
4. Data Standardization: Standardizing the data is vital for ensuring that attributes with different scales do not bias the analysis. We've standardized the data using scikit-learn.
5. PCA for Dimensionality Reduction: In a unique twist, we explore Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and showcase how it can be applied to image data.
6. Data Splitting and Analysis: We split the dataset into training and testing sets, calculating and comparing means and standard deviations, a crucial step for machine learning.
7. Data Discretization: We demonstrate data discretization techniques for specific attributes, making them more manageable for analysis.

# Visualization and Insights
Throughout the project, we provide visualizations, insights, and explanations to help you understand the various preprocessing techniques applied to the dataset.

We encourage you to explore our project and learn about data preprocessing techniques that are essential for any data scientist or data engineer. Feel free to clone this repository and use it as a resource for your own data projects or as a learning tool for data preprocessing best practices.

Happy data preprocessing!
